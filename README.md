# ScratchNote
A lightweight note taking application created using React.js and featuring
icons from FontAwesome.

## Usage
To use ScratchNote begin by cloning the repository. Then, navigate 
to the project folder via commmand line and type in "npm start" to enter
the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the
browser. 

## Notes
- Both the note title and content fields are required to create a note.
- ScratchNote currently only runs locally
- There is no local storage or database implemented at this time, thus
all notes will be lost upon reloading the page
